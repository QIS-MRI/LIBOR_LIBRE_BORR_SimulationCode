# LIBOR_LIBRE_BORR_SimulationCode
Contains matlab code to numerically simulate LIBOR, LIBRE, and BORR RF pulses. Also contains links to anonymized volunteer data from free-breathing 3D radial whole-heart MRI scans (DICOMS and RAW DATA).

Publication (Pre-print):

Contains:
- Main_LIBOR_paper.m: Script to simulate the RF pulses and generate manuscript figures (including RF waveforms)
- All other m files are auxiliary functions

Acknowledgement:
The framework of Brian Hargreaves was used as bases for the current simulations (http://mrsrl.stanford.edu/~brian/bloch/)
